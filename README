# I created this script because I'm lazy, and
# I did not want to do all these operations by hand.

# I know that I can write better code, but as I said I'm lazy.

IMPORTANT: This script run succesfully in RedHat based distro only 
(tested on CentOS, Red-Hat Enterpise, OpenSuSe)



This script allows you to create a complete Apache Virtual Host and statistics with Awstats in a few seconds.

-------------- ENVIROMENT----------------------

The environment for the web site will be created as follows:

/USER/DIR/                                                                 
     |                                                                        
     |-- sitename/                                                          
         |-- www/                                                            
         |-- perl/                                                          
         |-- python/                                                         
         |-- logs/                                                            
         |-- awstats/                                                           
         |-- error/                                                          
         |-- etc/         

www 	Root Directory
perl 	Aliases for perl scripts
python  Aliases for Python scripts
logs 	Access/Error logs for Virtual Host [NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format] (RO)
awstats cache for statistics (RO)
error 	error page for customizations
etc 	awstats user/password (RW), 
     	htaccess template(RO), 
     	script logrotate(RO), 
     	htaccess file for password(RW)

   The credentials are the same as the FTP.
4- Make file configuration for Virtual Host and puts it in to the folder of Apache that will include.
5- Make script for logrotate and set it in cron root
6- Set user quota (system quota must be configured)
