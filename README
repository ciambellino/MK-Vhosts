# I created this script because I'm lazy, and
# I did not want to do all these operations by hand.

# I know that I can write better code, but as I said I'm lazy.

IMPORTANT: This script run succesfully in RedHat based distro only 
(tested on CentOS, Red-Hat Enterpise, OpenSuSe)



This script allows you to create a complete Apache Virtual Host and statistics with Awstats in a few seconds.

-------------- ENVIROMENT----------------------

The environment for the web site will be created as follows:

/USER/DIR/                                                                 
     |                                                                        
     |-- sitename/                                                          
         |-- www/                                                            
         |-- perl/                                                          
         |-- python/                                                         
         |-- logs/                                                            
         |-- awstats/                                                           
         |-- error/                                                          
         |-- etc/         

www 	Root Directory
perl 	Aliases for perl scripts
python  Aliases for Python scripts
logs 	Access/Error logs for Virtual Host [NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format] (RO)
awstats cache for statistics (RO)
error 	error page for customizations
etc 	awstats user/password (RW), 
     	htaccess template(RO), 
     	script logrotate(RO), 
     	htaccess file for password(RW)



---------------- SCRIPT AUTOMATION --------------------------

1- Make enviroment dir
2- The scripts set system user/password for access in FTP. 
3- Set Awstats configuration for the Virtual Host with password protected access. 
   The credentials are the same as the FTP.
4- Make file configuration for Virtual Host and puts it in to the folder of Apache that will include.
5- Make script for logrotate and set it in cron root
6- Set user quota (system quota must be configured)
7- Set appropriate file permissions
8- Sets the date for the hosting of one year from the creation.
   Optionally in conjunction with the script expire.php can automatically alert the expiry of the web 	 space by sending an email to the addresses registered.
   For sending email in my system i configure the SMTP with authentication, and i use PEAR Net_SMTP    
   Class. The script expire.php use this for sending email. 
9- Make available information of the Virtual Hosts in a file  
10- Make alias for phpMyAdmin in /myadmin (phpMyAdmin must be installed in Apache RootDirectory)
